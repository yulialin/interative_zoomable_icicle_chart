This is an interactive icicle chart.

Inspired by https://observablehq.com/@d3/icicle Observable.Inc 

What I added:
  * Zoomable feature, click to change the focus node and showcase a different persepctive of the data, zoom in / out to show relational data
  * Implemented Google Sheet's API, updates data visualization chart in real-time when changes are made to the dataset's spreadsheets
  * Color picker feature, to represent hierarchical relationship in any color of users' choice, from light to dark accordingly
  * Mouseover modal to show metadata of the specific cells
  * Flagging feature, make cells that have been flagged stand out
